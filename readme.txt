Cerinta problemei este urmatoarea:

    Suppose there is a circle. There are N petrol pumps on that circle. Petrol pumps are numbered 0 to (N-1) (both inclusive).
    We have two pieces of information corresponding to each of the petrol pump:
    (1) the amount of petrol that particular petrol pump will give
    (2) the distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump
    Initially, we have a tank of infinite capacity carrying no petrol. We can start the tour at any of the petrol pumps.
    It is necessary to calculate the first point from where the truck will be able to complete the circle. Consider that 
    the truck will stop at each of the petrol pumps. The truck will move one kilometer for each litre of petrol.
